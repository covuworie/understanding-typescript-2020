Understanding TypeScript - 2020 Edition

This repository contains my code solutions from the Udemy course [Understanding TypeScript - 2020 Edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/).

## Running the code

Each individual lesson is treated as a separate `node` project. To execute the code do the following:

1. Navigate to the root-level folder of a lesson containing a `package.json` file.
2. Run ```npm install``` to install the `node modules`. The `typescript` compiler will be installed locally when you execute this command.
3. In earlier projects, run ```node_modules/.bin/tsc app.json``` to compile the `app.ts` file. Or in later projects run ```node_modules/.bin/tsc -w``` to automatically watch for and compile changes in multiple typescript files in the project.
